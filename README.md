Title & Description
"Kitchen + Drink" Website
Since I already have a well developed portfolio site I am going to take a past project that I have been working with and expanding on over the past year and creating a website for a concept I recently drafted as the next step in this project. I want to be able to not only achieve the creation of the graphics for this but also the development aspect of it. The original concept of "Kitchen + Drink" was a magazine that covered any information relating to the restaurant/bar business in San Francisco and New York City. So this will be the magazines site where past issues will be archived, a blog post could be set up, etc.
