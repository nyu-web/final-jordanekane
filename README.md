<h1>Title & Description</h1>
<h2>"Kitchen + Drink" Website</h2>

<p>Since I already have a well developed portfolio site I am going to take a past project that I have been working with
    and expanding on over the past year and creating a website for a concept I recently drafted as the next step in this
    project. I want to be able to not only achieve the creation of the graphics for this but also the development aspect
    of it. The original concept of "Kitchen + Drink" was a magazine that covered any information relating to the
    restaurant/bar business in San Francisco and New York City. So this will be the magazines site where past issues
    will be archived, a blog post could be set up, etc.</p>

<h1>Outline</h1>
<p>Home Page- Logo, Search Bar - Main content will be two clickable linked images, "San Francisco" and "New York City".
    So the reader can chose which site to enter.
